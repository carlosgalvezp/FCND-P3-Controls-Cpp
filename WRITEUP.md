## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1643/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Implemented Controller

#### 1. Implemented body rate control in python and C++.

#### 2. Implement roll pitch control in python and C++.

#### 3. Implement altitude control in python.

#### 4. Implement altitude controller in C++.

#### 5. Implement lateral position control in python and C++.

#### 6. Implement yaw control in python and C++.

#### 7. Implement calculating the motor commands given commanded thrust and moments in C++.

### Flight Evaluation

#### 1. Your python controller is successfully able to fly the provided test trajectory, meeting the minimum flight performance metrics.

#### 2. Your C++ controller is successfully able to fly the provided test trajectory and visually passes inspection of the scenarios leading up to the test trajectory.
